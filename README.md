## Argument Game

A card game made in Godot Engine 3.0

I started this project as a means to learn the Godot engine, with C++.

Almost all of the game will be implemented in C++, with only editor functionality allowed within GD Scripts.

I'm also using this project as means to better understand the set up of project pipelines and tools.

The three main tools I'm planning on using are GitHub for source control, Asana for project planning and Azure DevOps for CI.
